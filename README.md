# AI Workshop for Reduced Order Modeling 
## Agenda

High-fidelity models, such as those based on FEA (Finite Element Analysis), CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics), and CAE (Computer-Aided Engineering) models can take hours or even days to simulate. These full-order high-fidelity models, while being useful for detailed component design, are too slow and therefore impractical for system-level simulation, control design, and Hardware-in-the-Loop testing. For example, a finite element analysis model that is useful for detailed component design will be too slow to include in system-level simulations for verifying your control system or to perform system analyses that require many simulation runs. A high-fidelity model for analyzing NOx emissions will be too slow to run in real time in your embedded system. Does this mean you have to start from scratch to create faster approximations of your high-fidelity models? This is where reduced-order modeling (ROM) comes to the rescue. ROM is a set of computational techniques that helps you reuse your high-fidelity models to create faster-running, lower-fidelity approximations. 

In today's hands-on workshop, you will learn how to create AI-based reduced order models using the new Simulink add-on for Reduced Order Modeling to replace high-fidelity models.
